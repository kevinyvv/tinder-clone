If interested in seeing the app, I will be uploading video demonstration/images of design/publishing site, whenever I'm finished with my math homework.


## Account Registration

Allows new users to sign up from home page, or returning users to sign back in. Achieves this by retrieving user information from database (with Post and Get requests).
Secure method of storing passwords with hashing and encryption packages (bcrypt). 
 
## Account Setup

Onboarding page after registration for new users to create their profile (name, birthday, gender, preferences, about me, profile pictures).

## See and Swipe other Users

Dashboard page with other users' profiles that allows you to view and swipe (with same instructions as Tinder). However, Tinder's "recommendation" algorithm is not implemented.

## View "Matches" and Chat

Dashboard page with chat and matches sidebar, allowing users to view their matches and chat with them.
